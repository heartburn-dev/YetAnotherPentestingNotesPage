## Exploring Leaked Databases

I personally use Dehashed, which is fantastic. You pay a small sum for access weekly/monthly/yearly. It has a nice API and extensive data. 

You can search by company, name, mobile, address, and more. If you have an exposed login page for a company and know their emails, check if their users have been involved in past breaches. See a pattern that they've been involved in breaches using the password "yellow"? Then "yellow1995"? Then "Yellow1995!"? You get my point. Looking up past breached passwords for employees and users can sometimes lead to fruits in the present.
