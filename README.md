# ✨ Yet Another Pentesting Notes Page ✨

A nice, central place for all my notes from the last couple of years of studying/university. These commands worked at the time they were written and there's no guarantee they are still functioning in the same way. This repo serves as a reference point for me rather than flipping between Obsidian vaults.

❓❓ Please note: This is an evolving notes page and information will change. It is not yet complete nor will it be anytime soon! ❓❓

# Credits
