## Sliver Basic Setup

✨✨  https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver ✨✨

- Start the server
```bash
/opt/sliver/sliver-server_linux
```

- Add an operator and enable multiplayer
```bash
new-operator --name heartburn --lhost 10.10.14.111
multiplayer
```

Copy the generated .cfg file into the /home/username/.sliver-client/configs folder.

```bash
cp /opt/sliver/heartburn_10.10.14.111.cfg /home/inspired/.sliver-client/configs/
```

Start the client, and you will be presented with a choice of localhost or config that you specified. Choose the config that was created earlier.
